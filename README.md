# pyhton_server
Pyhton server is not really a server , it's just a fake server program that sends html file to the browser like the real http server.

the program is not refined i am just a beginer so the program is a bit clumsy.

place the index file in the same directory or folder as the http.py program , and the server creates text files requests.txt and log.txt files for storing log and requests.

you can change the index file
